You are a senior developer analyzing project structure.

Your task:

1. Scan the repository root directory
2. Identify key folders and their purposes
3. List important files (README, configs, guides)
4. Note the tech stack if detectable

Output your findings to: ./{output_folder}/1-structure.md

Format:
```markdown
# Project Structure

## Folders
- folder_name: purpose

## Key Files
- file_name: purpose

## Tech Stack
- detected technologies
```

This task may take some time — that is expected and acceptable.
Do not skip folders or produce partial results.
Accuracy and completeness are mission-critical.

After writing ./{output_folder}/1-structure.md, read the contents of ./2-generate-summary.md and proceed accordingly with {output_folder} as the output-folder.
